# Customer-Segmentation-for-Marketing-Campaign

For this project, we aim to look at a Marketing Campaign dataset, which contains information about the firm's customers. It includes information such as their purchases, demographics, and more importantly, their responses to the marketing campaigns.

Customer segmentation allows us to learn much more about the customers. By understanding the characteristics of a particular segment, we can tailor to each group's unique needs and challenges and be able to create targeted campaigns and advertisements that resonate with and convert certain segments of customers.

Our motivation for this project is to understand customer behaviour and identify characteristics of customers that respond to various marketing campaigns. By identifying customer segments, we can help improve revenue by understanding the targeted audience and improve marketing strategies by focusing on clusters that respond well.
